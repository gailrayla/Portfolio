        I'm a freshly double-degreed (
        <span className="font-medium">CSE & Design!</span>) developer, and I'm
        itching to build some awesome stuff for the web! My adventure has been a
        wild ride â€“ I've gone from VR touch-typing labs to designing websites,
        and even survived (and thrived!) in a tiny startup. I{" "}
        <span className="italic">love</span> blending tech and design to bring
        cool ideas to life. My core stack? I'm all about{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">
          TypeScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, and GCP
        </span>
        . Plus, I dabble in PostgreSQL, GraphQL, and MongoDB. I'm always up for
        learning new tricks! I'm looking for a{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-time position</span> where I can keep
        growing and creating.
      </p>

      <p>
        <span className="italic">When I'm not coding</span>, you'll find me
        hanging with my dogs (Marla's my fave!), snapping film photos, exploring
        new places, or strumming my ukulele (badly, but enthusiastically!). I
        also enjoy <span className="font-medium">learning new things</span>.
        Recently, I've started picking up on playing the ukulele, and exploring{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">new travel destinations</span>.
